# Relevance-Feedback-Model
Objective: Implement relevance feedback for language model 

In this new assignment, I've enhanced the retrieval model with pseudo relevance feedback. For a given query the following steps have been implemented:
(1)	Obtain feedback documents: initial search conducted using the query likelihood retrieval model with Dirichlet smoothing, and obtain top K documents where K is a parameter set by the system. These K documents are treated as the relevant documents;
(2)	For each query term qi in the query, probability of the feedback documents generating this term is calculated, i.e., P(qi | feedback documents). Here all feedback documents are treated as one big pseudo document;
(3)	Then for each query term qi, the probability of one document D generating it based on relevance feedback is a linear combination of the original probability P(qi | D) and P(qi | feedback documents), where parameter α is used as the coefficient of P(qi | D) and 1-α is used as the coefficient for P(qi | feedback documents);
(4)	The probability of the query generated by the document is all the probabilities of each query term multiplying together;
(5) Top N documents have been sorted based on the probability generated in step 4.
